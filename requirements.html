        <h2>Themes for Data Science Term Projects</h2>
        <p>Please select one of the following themes for your term project. Your project should focus on exploring datasets related to the chosen theme and addressing specific, well-defined engineering or data-driven research questions.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Supply Chain & Operations Management</strong>
                <p>Analyze the flow of goods, materials, and information to improve efficiency, resilience, and sustainability. This theme is ideal for industrial engineering applications.</p>
                <p><em>Possible Datasets:</em> Search <strong>Kaggle</strong> for "supply chain" or "logistics" datasets. Look for public trade data (e.g., <strong>UN Comtrade</strong>) or freight/shipping data. Large forecasting datasets (e.g., from Walmart) are also relevant.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Energy Systems & Grid Optimization</strong>
                <p>Study the *operational* side of energy, focusing on forecasting, optimization, and maintenance for power generation and distribution.</p>
                <p><em>Possible Datasets:</em> Find data from government portals like the US <strong>Energy Information Administration (EIA)</strong> or the <strong>National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)</strong>. Look for smart meter data or combine power generation data with weather data from <strong>NOAA</strong>.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Engineering Project Management & Financial Risk</strong>
                <p>Apply data science to the business and management side of engineering. Investigate the *economics* of engineering projects, from cost estimation to risk analysis.</p>
                <p><em>Possible Datasets:</em> Use the <strong>Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)</strong> to find the "Producer Price Index" (PPI) for commodities (steel, lumber). Check the <strong>World Bank</strong> or <strong>IMF</strong> for global commodity prices and infrastructure project data.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Summer Olympics: Systems & Performance</strong>
                <p>Use the Olympics as a rich dataset to analyze human performance or the complex logistics and economic impact of hosting a global event.</p>
                <p><em>Possible Datasets:</em> <strong>Kaggle</strong> is the best resource here. Search for "Olympics" to find historical data (120+ years) and datasets for recent games (Tokyo 2020, Paris 2024). Combine this with economic data (e.g., from <strong>FRED</strong>) for host cities.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Urban Systems & Smart Cities</strong>
                <p>Focus on the intersection of civil and systems engineering with data. Use data from urban environments to optimize services, infrastructure, and quality of life.</p>
                <p><em>Possible Datasets:</em> Explore your <strong>city's open data portal</strong> (e.g., for traffic, transit, 311 calls, or parking). The <strong>NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission</strong> dataset is a classic. Look for <strong>GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification)</strong> data for public transit schedules.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Climate Change & Environmental Engineering</strong>
                <p>Analyze the physical and environmental data related to climate change to model its impacts and inform engineering solutions.</p>
                <p><em>Possible Datasets:</em> Use <strong>NOAA's Climate Data Online</strong> for weather station data. Get air quality data from the <strong>EPA's AirData (AQS)</strong> portal. For geospatial analysis, use <strong>NASA's Earthdata (e.g., FIRMS</strong> for wildfires) or <strong>Google Earth Engine</strong>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
